    <h3>1. Data protection briefly</h3>
    <p> General information</p>
    <br>
    <p> The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data are all data with which you can be personally identified. Detailed information about data protection can be found in our data protection declaration listed below this text.</p>
   <h3> Data collection on our website</h3>
   <h4> Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>
   <p> The data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find their contact details in the legal notice of this website.</p>
    <h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>
    <p> On the one hand, your data is collected when you communicate it to us. This can be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form.</p>
    <p> Other data are automatically recorded by our IT systems when you visit the website. This is mainly technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of the page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>
   <h3> What do we use your data for?</h3>
    <p> Some of the data is collected to ensure that the website is error-free. Other data can be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>
    <h3>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h3>
    <p> You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data free of charge at any time. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice if you have any further questions about data protection. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>
    <h3>Analysis tools and third-party tools</h3>
    <p> When you visit our website, your surfing behavior can be statistically evaluated. This is done primarily with cookies and so-called analysis programs. Your surfing behavior is usually analyzed anonymously; surfing behavior cannot be traced back to you. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. You can find detailed information on this in the following data protection declaration.</p>
    <p> You can object to this analysis. We will inform you about the possibilities of objection in this data protection declaration.</p>
    <h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
    <h3>data protection</h3>
    <p> The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration.</p>
    <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This data protection declaration explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
    <p> Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal e-mail to us is sufficient for this. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the website operator, this site uses an SSL or. TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http: //” to “https: //” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
    <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
    Information, blocking, deletion
    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correct, block or delete this data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice if you have any further questions about personal data.</p>
    <h3>Objection to advertising mail</h3>
    <p>We hereby object to the use of the contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p>
    <h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p> Some of the internet pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and safer. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
    <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit.</p>
    <p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when you close the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.</p>
    <p>Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions you require (e.g., shopping cart function) are stored based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your surfing behavior) are stored, these will be treated separately in this data protection declaration.</p>
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p> The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <p>•    Browser type and browser version</p>
    <p>•	operating system used</p>
    <p>•	Referrer URL</p>
    <p>•	Host name of the accessing computer</p>
    <p>•	Time of the server request</p>
    <p>•	IP address</p>
    This data will not be merged with other data sources.
    The basis for data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
